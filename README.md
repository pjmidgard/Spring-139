Need to try to predict "0000-1111". Need to find string if cell equal 4 save. if we find on the string

[2:] and where it that on top, find if 0. if block not compress, times of Compression. Blocks long need an increase of the size of file//x bits-while increase size of the block comparable size of the file. Save how many long bits of compression block, not compression block and every time. Save Times of times of compression Add 1 on the start and 0-7 zeros two times. Save last bits of long. Binary file format .bin.
